          Hi! We are hearing students from a course at Boston University, Introduction to the Deaf World (SED DE 300). We are all new to learning about the Deaf community, and were tasked with a project to raise awareness about the Deaf World. We created a series of posters to place around our campus, which you will also find on this website. 
          If you scanned our QR code, hereâ€™s the place to check out our other designs and learn more!
